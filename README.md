## **CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION**

**Problem Statement**:
* The primary objective of this problem is to develop an accurate and efficient credit card fraud detection system that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions in real-time.

**Steps** :
* Understanding the data
* EDA
* Handling Imbalanced dataset 
* Model Building and Evaluation

**You can find the dataset from below link** :  [credit_card_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

**The dataset contains transactions made by the credit card users in 2 days**.
 * It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA .
 * Time and Amount are the only features that are not transformed by PCA.

**Did exploratory data analysis to gain some insights on data**:
 * **Class distribution**: plotted bar and pie plot to show that data is highly Imbalanced.
 * **Correlation Analysis** : plotted heat map : features like v17,v14,v11 are highly correlated with target column .
 * **Feature distribution** : plotted dist plot to show that these features are significant in classification of legit and fraud.
 * **time-based analysis** :
    * From both dist plot and hourly-based transactions plot  we can observe the peak hours.
    * daily basis transactions : Unfortunately as data contains only  transactions of 2 days ,there is no much significant difference in No of fraud transactions in 2 days.
* **amount based analysis**:
   * Average amount value of fraud transactions in both the days are significantly high as compared to legit transactions.
   * Dist plot : right skewed distribution for both transactions.

 Handled Imbalanced dataset using Under-Sampling technique to address the issue of Biased Model & Overfitting.

**Model Building and Evaluation**:
 * Created a pipeline which is a series of data preprocessing steps and models chained together in a specific sequence
 * Preprocessing steps include Normalization technique such as  Robust Scaling which handles outliers.
 * Implemented Multiple Models such as LogisticRegression,SVM &RandomForestClassifier and also evaluated these models by Precision , recall & F1 score.
 * cross-validation of these scores provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
 * RFC performes better  with an avg scores of : accuracy:0.93 ,Precision:0.97,F1 :0.92,recall : 0.90
